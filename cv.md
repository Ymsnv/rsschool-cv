### About me
#### My name is Yana, I'm 19 years old and now I study in BSU on the second course. It's getting harder and harder to study and  one day I realized I need something to change , I really need the activity I can develop myself. So that is why I'm here(rsschool). My goal is to gaining knowledge and learn somehing new to use it in future.
